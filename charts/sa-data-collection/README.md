***About this Chart:***

The chart's dependencies are minio and skydive charts

This chart runs a pre-install-job, that collects needed values from k8s and puts the results into **skydive-configuration config map** (that it creates)
The values:
- netmasks - for skydive netflow collection
- objectPrefix - for skydive to store objects
- guid - a unique id identifying the cluster's objects in object store
- containerRuntime

An additional configmap **sa-configuration** is defined as a template and stores the values related to minio configuration, that can be this way accessible to the skydive chart too.
